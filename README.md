# SimpleToDo
This is a simple to-do list app for iOS. Created to practice MVVM pattern and CoreData.

**Project status : Planing**

## 1. UI DESIGN
First step is deign a user interface.
I will use Sketch for all the design process.

Here's my first design. (Sketch file avaliable in the repository)

From left to right, start screen, main screen, view to-do screen, and Add to-do screen.  
When the to-do item is tapped, the popup with detail of the item will show and dim the background.  
Each to-do item will has only a title and a not-so-long note for simplicity.  

## 2. PLAN
